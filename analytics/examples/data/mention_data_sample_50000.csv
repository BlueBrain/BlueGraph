"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which were PCR-amplified and spotted on glass slides. They then hybridized their slides with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled genomic DNA or cDNAs derived from various virus-infected cells. Their multivirus-chip was found to be highly specific and sensitive for detecting different viral genomic sequences in cell lines. Moreover, the chip could also detect the effect of various drugs on viral gene expression. In such instance, cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and KSHV",16::3

inflammation,102:Discussion:22
Nordberg,102:Discussion:22
"Hodgkin's disease cell lines typically express high levels of CD30, other cell lines including LCL-721.220 or CCRF-CEM show at least 20- to 100-fold lower expression as determined by flow cytometry, yet the same selective targeting was observed. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of several related TNFR superfamily members in HeLa cells did not lead to their interaction with Trx1, yet CD30 strongly interacted on the same cells under the same conditions. Consistent with these findings, recent experiments demonstrate that Trx1 targets a particular site within the CD30 ectodomain (Y Balmer and TP Dick, unpublished data).",102:Discussion:25

"simian immunodeficiency virus (54), two viruses related to HIV-1. However, the use of an IRES by HIV-1 in the context of replication-competent viruses remains to be proven (45). The two strategies that are described above are not mutually exclusive. HIV-1 could first counteract changes in cap-dependent translation initiation by inhibiting PKR, until a larger stress in the cellular environment severely perturbs cap-dependent initiation. The virus would then switch to an IRES-driven mode to translate its full-length mRNA.",136:Discussion:27

"human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein has been shown to modulate their transactivation activities [20], [23]. We speculate that monoubiquitination is also an important machinery for post-translational modification and activation of CVB3 viral proteins. In the current study, we have shown that CVB3 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D is post-translationally modified by ubiquitination, suggesting a critical role of protein ubiquitination in the regulation of viral protein functions.",164:Discussion:18
