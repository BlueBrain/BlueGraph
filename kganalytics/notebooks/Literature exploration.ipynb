    "# Literature exploration by term co-occurrance analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we illustrate how network analytics can be used for literature exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input dataset contains occurrences of different terms in paragraphs of scientific articles previously extracted by means of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. This dataset is transformed into three co-occurrence networks: representing paper-, section- and paragraph-level co-occurrence relation between terms. The term relations in the above-mentioned networks are quantified using mutual-information-based scores (pointwise mutual information and its normalized version).\n",
    "\n",
    "The networks are further analysed using classical tools from complex networks: we find various centrality measures characterizing the importance of extracted terms, we detect term communities representing denesely connected clusters of terms and finally we illustrate how the algorithms for finding shortest paths and minimum spanning trees can be used to perform guided search in networks."
