    The paths are indirect in the sense that, if there exists a direct edge
    from the source to the target node, it is discarded as the search result.
    Therefore, the result of this function consists of paths with two
    or more edges. Two search strategies are available: 'naive' and 'yen'.
    The naive strategy first finds the set of all shortest paths from the
    source to the target node, it then ranks them by the cumulative distance
    score and returns n best paths. The second strategy uses Yen's
    algorithm [1] for finding n shortest paths. The first naive strategy
    performs better for highly dense graphs (where every node is connected to
    almost every other node).
