    "In this notebook we will illustrate how interactive exploration and analysis of the [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) dataset can be performed using the `cord19kg` package. The exploration and analysis techniques presented here focus on named entities and their co-occurrence in the scientific articles constituting the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data for this notebook contains the named entities extracted from a small selection of 20 articles representing 10 different entity types (i.e. proteins, chemicals, drugs, diseases, condtions, organs, organisms, pathways, cell types, cell compartments). The article selection corresponds to 20 most relevant articles to the query _\"Glucose is a risk factor of COVID-19\"_ obtained using the article search model [ref to blue brain search](). The entity extraction was performed using the Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques also included in [ref to blue brain search]().\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cord19kg` package provides a set of tools for interactive literature exploration through the named entity co-occurrence analysis consisting of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Data preparation__ step converts raw mentions into aggregated entity occurrence statistics.\n",
    "2. __Data curation__ step allows the user to manage extracted entities: modify, filter them and link to the ontology.\n",
    "3. __Network generation__ step allows creating entity co-occurrence networks based on paper-, section- and paragraph-level co-occurrence relations between entities. These entity relations are quantified using mutual-information-based scores (pointwise mutual information and its normalized version).\n",
    "4. __Network visualization and analysis__ step allows the user to perform interactive network visualization, edit network elements and perform its analysis (spanning tree, mutual-information based shortest paths between entities, etc)."
