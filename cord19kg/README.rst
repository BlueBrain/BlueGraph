:code:`cord19kg` package
========================

The package contains a set of tools for interactive exploration and analysis of the `CORD-19 <https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge>`_ dataset using the co-occurrence analysis of the extracted named entities. It includes data preparation and curation helpers, tools for generation and analysis of co-occurrence networks. Moreover, it provides several mini-applications (based on `JupyterDash <https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash>`_ and `ipywidgets <https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_) for Jupyter notebooks allowing the user to interactively perform:

- entity curation;
- network visualization and analysis;
- dataset saving/loading from `Nexus <https://bluebrainnexus.io/>`_.
